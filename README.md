# WarningList

Hi it's my new project! Your name WarningList. 
This programm allows you to evaluate your situation with ratings. 
This program is only suitable for students who need to quickly calculate their average score. So far, the program is quite raw. 
I will try to release updates for my creation as often as possible. :)
